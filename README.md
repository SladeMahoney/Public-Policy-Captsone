## Abstract
Deportation policy in the United States is a highly contentious topic. Little has been studied
about how deportation policies affect countries that receive deportations or whether these
policies may in fact lead to future migrations. In this paper, I examine the impacts of
repatriations on violence in El Salvador between 2010 and 2017. Using a fixed-effects model, I
find that criminal repatriations may increase assaults while non-criminal repatriations decrease
assaults at a statistically significant level. Repatriation impacts on homicides had a much smaller
magnitude and effect. Despite the limitations of our data, these findings contribute to
the growing research on the possible impacts of deportations on deportation-receiving countries.
